Bias in causal inference
======
In simple example, for linear regression, The space of the solution, which is generated by covariates vectors with unreplaceable part of the space represented by the error term. Based on the correlation (or non-linear relathionship) among the covariates, some unobserved covariates will be also represented by the onserved ones. This could lead to the result that the coefficient of some certain parameter (covariate) contains not only the effect of itself but also the effect of some other covariates correlated (or related) to this parameter, no matter observeable or unobservable. This phenomenon will lead the coefficnents not to be a good proxity to describe the causal effect of some given parameter.
